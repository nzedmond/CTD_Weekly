1. I had an aha moment when I learned controlled hooks. I was amazed but how much control one has over the GUI.
Before the class started, I was worried about not being able to finish assignment or falling behind.
I feel curious and excited about new skills ahead. I want to be able to build a fully function website in one sitting. that might sound crazy, but that's what will make me proud.
