1. I want to be a software engineer because I clique with computer science subject matter and solving problems using algorithms is something that I'd love to spend my life doing.
At the end of this class, I already have about 3 projects that I want to tackle. Those projects solve some issues that students on my campus face daily and will help make their life easier.
A growth mindset helped me get a scholarship at the university I'm currently enrolled in. After applying to 19 schools and getting rejected, I had one school on my list that I wanted to try. The hopes were low but something told me that I had nothing to lose by applying. SO I submitted the application despite the previous 19 rejections and I got admitted.
The believe in yourself mindset has helped me so many times. When I started taking pictures, many people used to give me negative comments saying that my pictures were too dark. Deep down I could see the vision, so I didn't listen to them and instead, I kept practicing taking pictures and learning from professional photographers. I also learned some post production techniques that helped me improve the quality of my pictures and now I am proud.
